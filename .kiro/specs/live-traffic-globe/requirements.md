# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Live Traffic Globe is a real-time network traffic visualization system that monitors outgoing network connections from a macOS machine and displays them as animated arcs on a 3D globe. The system consists of a local backend agent that captures network traffic and geolocates destination IPs, and a web-based frontend that renders the traffic flows on an interactive 3D globe visualization.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Mac user, I want to see my outgoing network traffic visualized on a 3D globe in real-time, so that I can understand where my data is going geographically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is running THEN it SHALL continuously monitor outgoing network traffic from the local machine
2. WHEN an outgoing connection is detected THEN the system SHALL identify the destination IP address
3. WHEN a destination IP is identified THEN the system SHALL convert it to geographic coordinates using geolocation services
4. WHEN geographic coordinates are obtained THEN the system SHALL display an animated arc from the user's location to the destination on a 3D globe
5. IF the destination IP is a private/local address THEN the system SHALL ignore it and not display it on the globe

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the backend agent to run locally on my Mac with appropriate permissions, so that it can securely monitor network traffic without sending sensitive data externally.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend agent starts THEN it SHALL request necessary system permissions to monitor network traffic
2. WHEN monitoring network traffic THEN the agent SHALL use macOS built-in tools like nettop for traffic capture
3. WHEN processing traffic data THEN the agent SHALL only extract destination IP addresses and ignore sensitive packet contents
4. WHEN the agent runs THEN it SHALL operate as a local WebSocket server to communicate with the frontend
5. IF the agent loses connection to the frontend THEN it SHALL stop monitoring traffic to preserve system resources

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want a web-based frontend that displays the 3D globe visualization, so that I can view the traffic patterns in an intuitive and visually appealing way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display a 3D interactive globe using the user's current location as the center point
2. WHEN the frontend connects to the backend agent THEN it SHALL establish a WebSocket connection for real-time data
3. WHEN traffic data is received THEN the frontend SHALL animate arcs from the user's location to destination coordinates
4. WHEN displaying arcs THEN the system SHALL show destination information including IP, city, and country
5. WHEN too many arcs accumulate THEN the system SHALL remove older arcs to maintain performance
6. IF the WebSocket connection fails THEN the frontend SHALL display connection status and error information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to provide clear status information and handle errors gracefully, so that I can troubleshoot issues and understand the system's current state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend agent starts THEN it SHALL log startup status and connection information
2. WHEN the frontend loads THEN it SHALL display connection status and user location information
3. WHEN geolocation requests fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and continue processing other traffic
4. WHEN the user denies location permissions THEN the frontend SHALL display an appropriate message and use a default location
5. IF system permissions are insufficient THEN the backend SHALL provide clear error messages about required permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to be easy to set up and run, so that I can quickly start visualizing my network traffic without complex configuration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN it SHALL require only standard Node.js and npm installation
2. WHEN running the backend THEN it SHALL use a simple command like "node agent.js"
3. WHEN running the frontend THEN it SHALL work by opening an HTML file in any modern web browser
4. WHEN dependencies are needed THEN they SHALL be installable via standard npm commands
5. IF the system requires sudo permissions THEN it SHALL clearly prompt the user and explain why

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want beautiful and impressive visual effects with colorized traffic by process type, so that I can easily distinguish different types of network activity and enjoy an engaging visualization experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN displaying traffic arcs THEN the system SHALL colorize arcs based on the originating process or application type
2. WHEN showing different process types THEN the system SHALL use distinct color schemes (e.g., browsers in blue, system processes in green, media apps in purple)
3. WHEN rendering arcs THEN the system SHALL include smooth gradient effects and particle animations along the arc paths
4. WHEN displaying connection points THEN the system SHALL show pulsing rings and glowing effects at destination locations
5. WHEN traffic volume is high THEN the system SHALL adjust arc thickness and intensity based on data volume
6. IF multiple connections exist to the same destination THEN the system SHALL aggregate them with enhanced visual effects

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want smooth and impressive animations throughout the interface, so that the visualization feels dynamic and engaging to watch.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new traffic appears THEN arcs SHALL animate smoothly from origin to destination with easing effects
2. WHEN arcs complete their journey THEN they SHALL fade out gracefully with particle dispersion effects
3. WHEN the globe rotates THEN it SHALL move smoothly with momentum-based physics
4. WHEN hovering over elements THEN they SHALL respond with smooth scale and glow transitions
5. WHEN data updates THEN the interface SHALL transition smoothly without jarring changes
6. IF performance allows THEN the system SHALL include ambient particle effects around the globe

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want comprehensive control options and filters, so that I can customize what traffic I see and how it's displayed according to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the interface THEN I SHALL be able to filter traffic by process name or application type
2. WHEN viewing traffic THEN I SHALL be able to toggle different categories on/off (browsers, system, media, etc.)
3. WHEN customizing display THEN I SHALL be able to adjust arc colors, thickness, and animation speed
4. WHEN analyzing traffic THEN I SHALL be able to set geographic filters to show/hide traffic from specific regions
5. WHEN monitoring THEN I SHALL be able to adjust the time window for how long arcs remain visible
6. WHEN exploring data THEN I SHALL be able to pause/resume the live feed and replay recent activity
7. IF I want detailed information THEN I SHALL be able to click on arcs or destinations to see connection details
8. WHEN personalizing THEN I SHALL be able to save and load different visualization presets
